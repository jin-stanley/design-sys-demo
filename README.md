Please try running the app and testing each hook, as all of them are functioning properly.

The application includes both a language provider and a theme provider, each with their respective hooks. These hooks enable global support for language localization and theme customization throughout the app.

Feel free to explore and experiment with different languages and themes using the provided hooks. If you encounter any issues or have any feedback, please let us know.

I hope you enjoy using this demo design system with its language and theme functionality!
